# The Challenge

This repository is the source code for an incomplete, pretend "Pok√©dex" web app. It's a code challenge, the challenge being to finish the web app by implementing a last minute major feature in the UI and API.

# Getting Started

## Cloning the Repo

You'll want to start by cloning the repo. (Instructions on cloning repos can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository.) Next, you'll want to make sure Node is installed (v12) as well as Yarn (v1, https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/). Now you're ready to run the UI and API locally

## Running the UI/API

To run the UI or the API locally, view the `README.md` files present in each directory.

_Note: In order to avoid any discrepancies running the dev servers, please make sure you're using Node ^12.8.0._

## The Task

# Tips

Here's some tips you might find handy:

- If you use an IDE like VS Code or Atom, install the ESLint and Prettier extensions. They help development a _lot!_
- Don't focus too much on UX or pretty design. Focus more on meeting the Acceptance Criteria and writing clean code.
- We're fans of the Functional Programming paradigm. As you code, thinking about how you can make your functions pure and avoid mutating objects.
